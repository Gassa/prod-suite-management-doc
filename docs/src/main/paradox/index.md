## Overview

The Lightbend Production Suite Management product provides functionality associated with the deployment and management of applications and services using The Reactive Platform.

The management product brings other Production Suite products together thereby taking a "batteries included" approach to service all of your runtime needs. The management product can also be considered the entrypoint into the Production Suite. Alternatively you may elect to use other Production Suite products in isolation of the management product, and configure them all to suit your specific needs. However we believe that the management component will get you started and look after you in the most comprehensive way whether your are targetting an Linux or DC/OS target. The Lightbend Production Suite management product makes decisions for you based on our real-world experience of running and managing Reactive systems.

The following diagram conveys the relationship of the management components within the Lightbend Production Suite.
