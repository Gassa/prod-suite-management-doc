## Overview

The Lightbend Production Suite Management capability provides functionality associated with the deployment and management of applications and services using The Reactive Platform.

The management capability brings other Production Suite capabilities together thereby taking a "batteries included" approach to service all of your runtime needs. The management capability can also be considered the entrypoint into the Production Suite. Alternatively you may elect to use other Production Suite capabilities in isolation of the management one, and configure them all to suit your specific needs. However we believe that the management capability will get you started and look after you in the most comprehensive way whether your are targeting a Linux or DC/OS target. The Lightbend Production Suite management capability makes decisions for you based on our real-world experience of running and managing Reactive systems.

The following diagram conveys the relationship of the management capability within the Lightbend Production Suite.
